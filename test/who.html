    <h1>Who was Miyamoto Musashi?</h1>
    <p>Miyamoto Musashi was a Japanese swordsman, considered by some to be the greatest in the country's history. 
        He was the author of the Book of Five Rings, and is said to have won over 60 duels within his lifetime. 
        He is known for developing a fighting style known as Ni-ten Ichi-ryu (Two Heavens, One Style), which uniquely uses two swords instead of one. 
        Due to his impact, he is a popular figure in Japanese media.
        In his Book of Five Rings, he lists his full name as being Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami Fujiwara no Harunobu. 
        Besides swordsmanship, he is known for philosophy and art.</p>
